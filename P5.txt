This problem didn't take any programming, just some common sense

1. The number must be divisible by all prime numbers from 1 to 20

2. The number must be divisible by all the exponents of the primes in the interval
    Powers of 2 -> 2, 4, 8, 16  
    Powers of 3 -> 3, 9
    Powers of 5 -> 5

3. We must be able to make all the other numbers in the interval with the prime factors of the constituent numbers

4. It must be the smallest such number 

This gives us: 2 * 5 * 8 * 9 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
