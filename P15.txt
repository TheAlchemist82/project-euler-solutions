This problem was solved using combinatorics

The Right and Down movements can be seen as an increase in the x and y directions.

The total number of "points" visited in both directions will be 40, 20 in x and 20 in y.

This makes the problem rather trivial, forming the equation 40^C_20 = 40!/ 20!^2 = 137846528820
